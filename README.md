# Haar MRA analysis and synthesis

1-dimensional Wavelet analysis program for the Haar wavelet written in Matlab

## Features

 - Signal analysis and synthesis.
 - Coefficients for approximations and details plotting.
 - Signal approximation reconstruction.
 - Energy of signal calculation.

## Installation
